        Scarlxrd, pronounced as “scarlord,” is a British “YouTuber”-turned-rapper, best known for his unusual musical compositions. Formerly known as “MazziMaz,” Scarlxrd mixes trap music with heavy metal to form his songs. He started his singing career as the lead vocalist of a metal band named ‘Myth City.’ His single ‘Heart Attack’ turned around his rap career when its music video hit more than 40 million “views.” As a “YouTuber,” he started his career by publishing comedy vlogs. He has also collaborated with fellow “YouTubers” Casper Lee and Sam Pepper in the past. After he founded ‘Myth City’ in 2014, Scarlxrd left his ‘YouTube’ career as “Mazzi Maz” behind. He later described his ‘YouTube’ career as “soul-destroying.” His fans quickly subscribed to his band and responded well to his vocals. The band released their first self-titled EP in 2015. As a solo artist, he released a music video named ‘Girlfriend’ in 2016. The same year, he released two albums, namely, ‘スカー藩主’ (Japanese for his self-titled album) and ‘Rxse’. He released the albums ‘Cabin Fever,’ ‘Chaxsthexry,’ and ‘Lxrdszn’ in 2017. In 2018, he released his sixth album, ‘Dxxm,’ via ‘Island Records.’
